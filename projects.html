                        I created this project to learn about encoding data visually and to practice working with JavaScript libraries. The highlight was successfully integrating a third-party QR code library and customizing the output. A key difficulty was handling different data types and ensuring the generated codes were always scannable across devices.

                        This project was built to understand authentication flows and user session management. The main highlight was implementing secure password handling and learning about hashing. The biggest challenge was ensuring security best practices and preventing common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and weak password storage.

                        This group project was developed at university to explore Python's capabilities and to gain hands-on experience with real-time communication protocols. The main achievement was implementing a peer-to-peer connection using Inter Process Communication and queues. One of the biggest challenges was handling network issues and maintaining stable connections between peers.
